# Serpens Malus

Serpens Malus (The Serpent's Apple), is a role-playing game for three or four friends. In the game, you 
play the roles of citizens of the city of Troy, just as the Trojan War begins. While your characters are 
generally safe behind the city walls, and the fall of Troy will not come for many years, your days are numbered.

## Characters

Each player chooses a name, pronouns, and an occupation for their character, suitable to the time. Each player also chooses a classical Greek god or goddess to act as their patron (and, secretly, their parent—every character is also a minor demigod/ess-in-hiding, unbeknownst to them). Choose a deity, and a skill or trait related to that god or goddess—your character will always succeed in matters related to that skill or trait.

Each player will also choose a Goal for their character. This is an overarching objective or purpose for the character, and should not be easily attained. This may be a political, social, or business agenda, attaining the love or favor of someone out of reach, the return of a family member, safe passage from the city, or any other big-picture ambition the character might have.

Write all these down somewhere, and note that each player also has one Apple. You may have up to three Apples, never more. You will also need a game Grid available, printed if possible, 11 x 11 squares containing a random assortment of the numbers 1-6, with several apples and skulls on it. (See TK this page)

The player to your right will be your Muse—they are responsible for the good things that happen to you. The player to your left is your Nemesis—they are responsible for the bad things that happen to you. When playing someone's Muse or Nemesis, build upon the current situation, adding obvious outcomes or surprise twists as needed, but be respectful of the player—make the story interesting, but make sure everyone is into it.

Finally, decide how your characters all know each other—write down your relationship to each other character, and one emotion or feeling that you associate with them. Decide together what your part of the city is like, the weather, time of year, and general feel of the setting, and you're ready to start!

To begin, each player will roll a six-sided die. That is your starting number—pick a square somewhere on the Grid containing that number, circle it, and draw an initial or other identifying mark inside. 

## Playing

To play, take turns setting up scenes with each other and roleplaying the interactions, creating charged situations that pull on the tensions of the characters' relationships or feelings for each other, the characters' Goals, or that draw on the larger context of the looming war, or the characters' parentage and boons, putting any of those things at hand, at risk, or both!

When something is in doubt, dangerous, frightening, or otherwise uncertain, you must move on the Grid to determine the outcome. Choose a number orthogonally adjacent to your current square (above/below/left/right, not diagonal) and circle that number, crossing out the square you are moving from. 

You may choose to keep your current number (from the square you are moving from) or re-roll your die to get a new number. Whichever you choose, compare the new number to the number in the square you have moved to.

* If the numbers match, you have succeeded! Narrate how you overcome the obstacle or challenge.
* If one number is one higher or lower than the other, you succeed, but there is some difficulty. Your Muse will narrate how you achieve your goal, then your Nemesis will give you a cost, complication, or hard choice.
* If the numbers are more than one apart, you are unsuccessful at overcoming your challenge, and in addition, something else bad happens as a result—your Nemesis will provide the badness, but everyone should agree what happens.

Continue roleplaying freely, turning to the Grid whenever necessary. 

## Apples and Skulls

There are a few extra wrinkles, naturally. 

If, when choosing a square to move to on the Grid, and you are forced to choose a Skull, an edge, or a square that has previously been visited and marked off (by you or another player), your character's story has come to an end. When the current scene wraps up, take a moment for a final solo scene describing how the character exits the story—through their own death, or otherwise—and after, the other players will act as a chorus, each adding one line in turn as an elegy. Players who exit the game this way may still play, either taking the roles of non-player characters in scenes, or adding details or suggesting complications as a spirit. 

If you move onto a square containing an Apple, that's good! This has a few effects: First, you automatically succeed at the task or challenge at hand—narrate your success as usual. Then add an Apple to your character's sheet, up to three. Don't mark off the spot! Circle it to indicate that you're there, and leave as usual at the next conflict, but another player may move onto the Apple square again without penalty—moving out may be more difficult, but that's another story.

You may spend Apples in the following ways, marking them off your sheet as you use them:

* Spend 1 Apple to re-roll your die an additional time when moving into a square. You may do this as many times as you like, as long as you have Apples to spend.
* Spend 1 Apple to change another player's number up or down one—whether this helps or hurts them is up to you.
* Spend 2 Apples to jump to any other unused square on the Grid that matches your current number. (You may not jump to an Apple or Skull square, clearly.)
* Spend 3 Apples to finally achieve your character's Goal! As with an exit, when the current scene ends, take a solo spotlight to describe how your dreams come true, then each player will act as a chorus, adding one line at a time until your memory is complete.

## Ending

Play until you feel that you've had enough, or until every character has either exited the game by running into a Skull, edge, or visited square, or achieved their Goal. You will be remembered.
